# T60 Config
This is the configuration for awesomewm with zsh and URXVT-256color as installed on my venerable IBM ThinkPad T60, running openSUSE without a desktop environment.

## NOTE TO SELF
Dear future self,

You probably haven't used this repository in a while, since realistically how often does a person really reinstall their OS (or bork it completely)?

When you wrote this your intent was that you'd clone this repository into e.g. `~/code/` and then symlink everything out from there, so something like:

```
$ ln -s /home/nathan/code/t60config/.Xresources /home/nathan/.Xresources
```

You're welcome, since you probably also forgot the syntax for `ln` you fucking wumpus.

XOXO
Your past self
